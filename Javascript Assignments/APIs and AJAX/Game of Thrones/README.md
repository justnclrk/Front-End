The Game of Thrones API is located here: ASOIAF (https://anapioficeandfire.com/). Their documentation is great and will show how to use their API. Images you may use are found here: Houses (http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3926/handouts/chapter3926_7250_gameofthrones.zip)

Note: An API Key is not needed.

When a User clicks an Image, the House Details should be appended or updated with the correct House information pulled from the API. For full names of the houses, you may check this entry.(https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-names-of-the-noble-houses-and-the-Seven-Kingdoms-of-Westeros)
